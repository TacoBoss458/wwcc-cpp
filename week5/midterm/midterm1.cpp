// This midterm covers project 7. I want this program to simulate a menu style program that
// sorts the menu between a movie adder, a movie searcher, year filter, a statistic display, 
// a watchlist area, and finally an exit prompt. It needs to allow the user to enter as many movies
// as they want. This means that each of the menu prompts needs to be infinite until the user 
// prompts to extt. that also means that there should be an exit prompt after each menu and sub menu.
