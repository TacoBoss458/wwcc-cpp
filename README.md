# About Me

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Isaiah Rusch. I am currently learning C++ programming.

## My Background

I am 18 years old. I am still in highschool and this is my first intensive priogramming class. I've done pruior work in Python and HTML but nothing like this before. I'm very intrested in the world of computer engineering and computer science. 

## Why I am learning C++

I'm learning C++ because i have very limited knowledge on intensive coding and would love to learn more about how to properly code. Someday i wish to help code a videogame, and this seems like the best place to start making that a reality. 

## Programmiong Knowledge

The programming languages i am famillier with are: 
- Python
- HTML

I have been programming for a few months now. 

## Favorites
